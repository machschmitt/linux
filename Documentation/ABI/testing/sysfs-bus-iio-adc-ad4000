What:		/sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:deviceX/turbo_en
KernelVersion:	6.8
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		This attribute is used to enable/disable turbo mode allowing
		slower SPI clock rates (at a minimum SCK rate of 75 MHz) to
		achieve the maximum throughput of 2 MSPS.

What:		/sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:deviceX/span_compression_en
KernelVersion:	6.8
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		This attribute is used to enable/disable the input span
		compression feature that reduces the ADC input range by 10% from
		the top and bottom of the range while still accessing all
		available ADC codes. Enabling span compression causes a
		decrease in ADC scale which is reflected in the channel
		in_voltageY_scale attribute.

What:		/sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:deviceX/status_bits_en
KernelVersion:	6.8
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		This attribute is used to make the chip append a 6-bit status
		word at the end of conversion results. The 6 status bits contain
		the configuration register fields for OV clamp flag, span
		compression, high-z mode, and turbo mode.

What:		/sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:deviceX/high_impedance_en
KernelVersion:	6.8
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		This attribute is used to enable/disable high impedance mode
		(high-z) which reduces nonlinear charge kickback to the ADC
		input.
