    enum: [ single, chain ]
    description: |
      This property indicates the SPI wiring configuration.

      When this property is omitted, it is assumed that the device is using what
      the datasheet calls "4-wire mode". This is the conventional SPI mode used
      when there are multiple devices on the same bus. In this mode, the CNV
      line is used to initiate the conversion and the SDI line is connected to
      CS on the SPI controller.

      When this property is present, it indicates that the device is using one
      of the following alternative wiring configurations:

      * single: The datasheet calls this "3-wire mode". (NOTE: The datasheet's
        definition of 3-wire mode is NOT at all related to the standard
        spi-3wire property!) This mode is often used when the ADC is the only
        device on the bus. In this mode, SDI is tied to VIO, and the CNV line
        can be connected to the CS line of the SPI controller or to a GPIO, in
        which case the CS line of the controller is unused.
      * chain: The datasheet calls this "chain mode". This mode is used to save
        on wiring when multiple ADCs are used. In this mode, the SDI line of
        one chip is tied to the SDO of the next chip in the chain and the SDI of
        the last chip in the chain is tied to GND. Only the first chip in the
        chain is connected to the SPI bus. The CNV line of all chips are tied
        together. The CS line of the SPI controller can be used as the CNV line
        only if it is active high.

  '#daisy-chained-devices': true

  vdd-supply:
    description: A 1.8V supply that powers the chip (VDD).

  vio-supply:
    description:
      A 1.8V to 5.5V supply for the digital inputs and outputs (VIO).

  ref-supply:
    description:
      A 2.5 to 5V supply for the external reference voltage (REF).

  cnv-gpios:
    description:
      The Convert Input (CNV). This input has multiple functions. It initiates
      the conversions and selects the SPI mode of the device (chain or CS). In
      'single' mode, this property is omitted if the CNV pin is connected to the
      CS line of the SPI controller.
    maxItems: 1

  adi,high-z-input:
    type: boolean
    description:
      High-Z mode allows the amplifier and RC filter in front of the ADC to be
      chosen based on the signal bandwidth of interest, rather than the settling
      requirements of the switched capacitor SAR ADC inputs.

  adi,gain-milli:
    description: |
      The hardware gain applied to the ADC input (in milli units).
      The gain provided by the ADC input scaler is defined by the hardware
      connections between chip pins OUT+, R1K-, R1K1-, R1K+, R1K1+, and OUT-.
      If not present, default to 1000 (no actual gain applied).
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32
    enum: [454, 909, 1000, 1900]
    default: 1000

  interrupts:
    description:
      The SDO pin can also function as a busy indicator. This node should be
      connected to an interrupt that is triggered when the SDO line goes low
      while the SDI line is high and the CNV line is low ('single' mode) or the
      SDI line is low and the CNV line is high ('multi' mode); or when the SDO
      line goes high while the SDI and CNV lines are high (chain mode),
